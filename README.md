# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

This project is about implementing various functions for binary tree data structures in C.

## Project Structure

- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing structure definitions and function prototypes.
- `binary_tree_node.c`: Function to create a new binary tree node.
- `binary_tree_insert_left.c`: Function to insert a node as the left child of another node.
- `binary_tree_insert_right.c`: Function to insert a node as the right child of another node.
- Other .c files corresponding to each task.

## Compilation

The project files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the following flags:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <file.c> -o <output>
```
