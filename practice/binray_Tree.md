#Binary tree

is a tree data structure(non-linear) in which each node can have at most two children which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and
the bottom-most nodes are called leaves.

A binary tree can be visualized as a hierarchical structure with the root at the top and the leaves at the bottom.

#Representation of Binary Tree
Each node in a Binary Tree has three parts:

Data
Pointer to the left child
Pointer to the right child

#Below is the representation of a Node of Binary Tree C:

struct Node{
int data;
struct Node*left;
struct Node*right;
}

#Operations On Binary Tree

#1. Insertion in Binary Tree
We can insert a node anywhere in a binary tree by inserting the node as the left or right child of any node or by making the node as root of the tree.

Algorithm to insert a node in a Binary Tree:

Check if there is a node in the binary tree, which has missing left child. If such a node exists, then insert the new node as its left child.
Check if there is a node in the binary tree, which has missing right child. If such a node exists, then insert the new node as its right child.
If we donâ€™t find any node with missing left or right child, then find the node which has both the children missing and insert the node as its left or right child.
